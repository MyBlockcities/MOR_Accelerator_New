## Deployment Progress

### Already Deployed

1. **Builder Contract**:
   - Deployed on Arbitrum and Base
   - Core functionality working
   - Can create pools, stake, and unstake

2. **Treasury Contract**:
   - Deployed on Arbitrum and Base
   - Configured to work with Builder contract
   - Can distribute rewards

3. **Fee Config Contract**:
   - Deployed on Arbitrum and Base
   - Configuration for fee calculations

4. **Frontend UI**:
   - Basic UI components implemented
   - Builder pool management UI working
   - Staking and rewards UI implemented

### Missing or Incomplete

1. **Feature Market Contract**:
   - Needs deployment with proper MOR token address
   - Integration with frontend components

2. **MOR Token Address**:
   - Need to confirm or deploy MOR token
   - Required for staking and feature market

3. **Reputation System**:
   - Needs deployment and integration

4. **Cross-Chain Functionality**:
   - LayerZero integration needs completion
   - Testing of cross-chain messages required

5. **IPFS Integration**:
   - No clear IPFS integration found
   - Needed for metadata storage

6. **Complete Testing Suite**:
   - More comprehensive tests needed
   - Cross-chain testing required

## Project Configuration

The project is configured for multiple networks:

1. **Primary Networks**:
   - Arbitrum Mainnet (ChainID: 42161)
   - Base Mainnet (ChainID: 8453)

2. **Test Networks**:
   - Arbitrum Sepolia (ChainID: 421614)
   - Base Goerli (ChainID: 84531)

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - RPC endpoints configured via Infura
   - Etherscan API integration for contract verification
   - Hardhat for contract deployment and testing

## Next Steps for Deployment

Based on the code review, here are the prioritized next steps:

1. **Feature Market Deployment**:
   - Deploy the Feature Sponsorship Market contract
   - Connect to MOR token address
   - Integrate with frontend components

2. **Complete Cross-Chain Integration**:
   - Finalize LayerZero integration
   - Test message passing between Arbitrum and Base
   - Implement cross-chain staking functionality

3. **IPFS Integration**:
   - Set up IPFS project
   - Implement metadata storage
   - Connect to frontend components

4. **Reputation System**:
   - Deploy Reputation System contract
   - Integrate with frontend
   - Test reputation tracking

5. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Complete unit and integration tests
   - Test across all supported networks
   - Security testing

6. **Production Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up production environment variables
   - Configure for mainnet deployment
   - Set up monitoring and analytics

## Conclusion

The Morpheus Builder platform has made significant progress, with core contracts already deployed on both Arbitrum and Base networks. The Builder Pool Management system is fully functional, allowing users to create pools, stake tokens, and earn rewards.

The main areas requiring completion are the Feature Market contract deployment, cross-chain functionality via LayerZero, and IPFS integration. Once these components are completed and thoroughly tested, the platform will be ready for production deployment.

The existing deployment scripts, contract code, and frontend components provide a solid foundation, and the project appears to be 60-70% complete in terms of functionality. With focused effort on the remaining components, the platform could be ready for full deployment within the timeline outlined in the Deployment Assessment document (5-8 weeks).
