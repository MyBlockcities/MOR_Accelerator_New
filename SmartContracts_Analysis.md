# Morpheus Builder: Smart Contract Analysis

After analyzing the provided smart contracts in your project, I've categorized them based on their relevance, current usage status, and required integration for your application.

## Contract Categories

### 1. Currently Used Core Contracts

These contracts are actively being used in your application and are already deployed on Arbitrum and Base:

#### Builder System
- **IMorpheusBuilder.sol**: Main interface for the Builder Pool system
  - Deployed on Arbitrum: `0xC0eD68f163d44B6e9985F0041fDf6f67c6BCFF3f`
  - Deployed on Base: `0x42BB446eAE6dca7723a9eBdb81EA88aFe77eF4B9`
  - Properly configured in your application

- **IMorpheusTreasury.sol**: Manages reward distribution and fees
  - Deployed on Arbitrum: `0xCBE3d2c3AdE62cf7aa396e8cA93D2A8bff96E257`
  - Deployed on Base: `0x9eba628581896ce086cb8f1A513ea6097A8FC561`
  - Properly configured in your application

- **IMorpheusFeeConfig.sol**: Handles fee configuration and minimums
  - Deployed on Arbitrum: `0xc03d87085E254695754a74D2CF76579e167Eb895`
  - Deployed on Base: `0x845FBB4B3e2207BF03087b8B94D2430AB11088eE`
  - Properly configured in your application

### 2. External Token Contracts

These contracts represent interfaces to external tokens that are already deployed:

- **IMOR.sol**: MOR token interface
  - Deployed on Ethereum: `0xcBB8f1BDA10b9696c57E13BC128Fe674769DCEc0`
  - Deployed on Arbitrum: `0x092baadb7def4c3981454dd9c0a0d7ff07bcfc86`
  - Deployed on Base: `0x7431ada8a591c955a994a21710752ef9b882b8e3`
  - **Configuration Status**: Addresses added to .env but need to implement the interface connection in the application

- **IOFT.sol**: Omnichain Fungible Token interface for LayerZero functionality
  - Part of the MOR token implementation
  - **Configuration Status**: Needs to be connected to existing LayerZeroService.ts

### 3. Contracts To Be Deployed

These contracts exist in your codebase but haven't been deployed yet:

- **FeatureSponsorshipMarket.sol**: Feature marketplace with milestone-based payments
  - **Configuration Status**: Ready for deployment, needs to be deployed with the correct MOR token address
  - Deployment script exists: `deploy_feature_sponsorship.ts`
  - Will need to be deployed to both Arbitrum and Base

- **ReputationSystem.sol** (in backup directory)
  - **Configuration Status**: Available for deployment if needed
  - Deployment script exists: `deploy_reputation_system.ts`

### 4. Legacy/Deprecated Contracts

These contracts appear to be older versions that have been superseded by newer implementations:

- **IBuilder.sol**: Older interface for builder pools, superseded by IMorpheusBuilder
  - **Recommendation**: Do not use in current implementation

- **TokenStaking.sol**: Basic staking contract, functionality now in Builder contract
  - **Recommendation**: Do not use in current implementation

- **DeveloperRegistry.sol**, **FeatureRequests.sol**, **Bidding.sol**, **EscrowPayment.sol**
  - **Recommendation**: These appear to be older implementations or components that have been combined into the FeatureSponsorshipMarket contract

- **MORToken.sol** (in backup directory)
  - **Recommendation**: Not needed as official MOR tokens are already deployed

### 5. Cross-Chain Integration 

These contracts are part of the LayerZero cross-chain functionality:

- **IDistribution.sol**: Interface for token distribution
  - Connected to Ethereum distribution contract: `0x47176B2Af9885dC6C4575d4eFd63895f7Aaa4790`
  - **Configuration Status**: Need to integrate with existing distribution contract

- **LayerZero Endpoints**:
  - L1Sender on Ethereum: `0x2Efd4430489e1a05A89c2f51811aC661B7E5FF84`
  - L2MessageReceiver on Arbitrum: `0xd4a8ECcBe696295e68572A98b1aA70Aa9277d427`
  - L2TokenReceiverV2 on Arbitrum: `0x47176b2af9885dc6c4575d4efd63895f7aaa4790`
  - **Configuration Status**: Addresses added to .env but integration needs to be completed

## Required Actions

Based on the contract analysis, here are the specific integration actions needed:

### 1. MOR Token Integration

```typescript
// Create a useMORToken hook
export function useMORToken(chainId: number) {
  // Get the correct MOR token address based on the chain ID
  const tokenAddress = chainId === 1 
    ? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MOR_TOKEN_ETHEREUM
    : chainId === 42161 
      ? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MOR_TOKEN_ARBITRUM
      : process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MOR_TOKEN_BASE;
      
  // Connect to the token contract
  const { data: tokenContract } = useContract({
    address: tokenAddress as Address,
    abi: MOR_TOKEN_ABI,
  });
  
  // Implement token functions
  const approve = async (spender: Address, amount: BigNumber) => {
    if (!tokenContract) return;
    return tokenContract.approve(spender, amount);
  };
  
  const balanceOf = async (address: Address) => {
    if (!tokenContract) return BigNumber.from(0);
    return tokenContract.balanceOf(address);
  };
  
  return { 
    tokenContract,
    approve,
    balanceOf
  };
}
```

### 2. Feature Sponsorship Market Deployment

Update the deployment script to use the correct MOR token address:

```typescript
// In deploy_feature_sponsorship.ts
// Get the MOR token address based on the network
const getTokenAddress = (network: string) => {
  if (network === 'arbitrum') {
    return '0x092baadb7def4c3981454dd9c0a0d7ff07bcfc86';
  } else if (network === 'base') {
    return '0x7431ada8a591c955a994a21710752ef9b882b8e3';
  } else if (network === 'ethereum') {
    return '0xcBB8f1BDA10b9696c57E13BC128Fe674769DCEc0';
  }
  throw new Error("Unsupported network");
};

async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  const network = process.env.NETWORK || 'arbitrum';
  
  console.log("Deploying Feature Sponsorship Market with the account:", deployer.address);
  console.log("Network:", network);
  
  // Get the appropriate MOR token address
  const morTokenAddress = getTokenAddress(network);
  
  const FeatureSponsorshipMarket = await ethers.getContractFactory("FeatureSponsorshipMarket");
  const featureSponsorshipMarket = await upgrades.deployProxy(
    FeatureSponsorshipMarket,
    [morTokenAddress],
    { initializer: 'initialize' }
  );
  await featureSponsorshipMarket.deployed();
  
  console.log("FeatureSponsorshipMarket deployed to:", featureSponsorshipMarket.address);
}
```

### 3. LayerZero Integration

Update the LayerZeroService to use the official endpoints:

```typescript
// Update in LayerZeroService.ts

// LayerZero Chain IDs
const LZ_CHAIN_IDS = {
  ethereum: 1,    // Ethereum
  arbitrum: 110,  // Arbitrum
  base: 184       // Base
};

// Contract addresses by network
const L1_SENDER_ADDRESS = '0x2Efd4430489e1a05A89c2f51811aC661B7E5FF84'; // Ethereum
const L2_MESSAGE_RECEIVER_ADDRESS = '0xd4a8ECcBe696295e68572A98b1aA70Aa9277d427'; // Arbitrum
const L2_TOKEN_RECEIVER_ADDRESS = '0x47176b2af9885dc6c4575d4efd63895f7aaa4790'; // Arbitrum

export async function sendTokensCrossChain(
  fromChainId: number,
  toChainId: number,
  amount: BigNumber
) {
  // Implementation to send tokens cross-chain using LayerZero
  // This will use the MOR token's OFT functionality
}
```

## Summary of Smart Contract Status

| Contract | Status | Action Required |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Builder Contract | ‚úÖ Deployed & Configured | None |
| Treasury Contract | ‚úÖ Deployed & Configured | None |
| Fee Config Contract | ‚úÖ Deployed & Configured | None |
| MOR Token | ‚úÖ Deployed, ‚ùå Not Integrated | Implement token interface connection |
| Feature Market | ‚ùå Not Deployed | Deploy using existing script |
| LayerZero Cross-Chain | üü° Partially Implemented | Complete integration with endpoints |
| IPFS Integration | ‚ùå Not Implemented | Set up for metadata storage |

## Conclusion

Your MOR_Accelerator_New project already has the core contracts deployed and configured correctly. The primary focus now should be on:

1. Properly integrating with the MOR token contracts on each chain
2. Deploying the Feature Sponsorship Market contract
3. Completing the LayerZero cross-chain functionality

The legacy contracts in the backup directory should not be used in the current implementation, as they have been superseded by newer versions or are not relevant to the current architecture.
